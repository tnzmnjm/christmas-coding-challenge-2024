# christmas-coding-challenge-2024
This project was developed within the framework of the Christmas Coding Challenge 2024, organised by Women Coding Community.

I am taking on this challenge as part of the book [Build a Large Language
Model (From Scratch)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) 
To create, train, and fine-tune large language models (LLMs), Iâ€™m focused 
on building my PyTorch skills, and this challenge presents a perfect 
opportunity to learn it in a structured and disciplined way. My goal is to 
make consistent progress by committing to this repository daily.
